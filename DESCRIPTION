Description: Provides an interface for the "nVenn"" algorithm. This algorithm works for any number of sets, 
    and usually yields pleasing and informative Venn diagrams with proportionality information. 
    However, representing more than six sets takes a long time and is hard to interpret, unless many of the 
    regions are empty. If you cannot make sense of the result, you may want to consider 'UpSetR'.
