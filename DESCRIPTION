Description: Please, be aware that a second version of this package (nVennR2) is also available
    (<https://github.com/vqf/nVennR2>). 
    The second version is faster and gives better results in most cases. This first version is intended
    mainly for fringe cases and users who have incorporated this algorithm into their procedures.
    Provides an interface for the "nVenn"" algorithm (Perez-Silva, Araujo-Voces and Quesada (2018), 
    <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty109>). This algorithm works for any number of sets, 
    and usually yields pleasing and informative Venn diagrams with proportionality information. 
    However, representing more than six sets takes a long time and is hard to interpret, unless many of the 
    regions are empty. If you cannot interpret the result, you may want to consider 'UpSetR'.
