Description: This package provides an interface for the nVenn algorithm
    <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty109>. This algorithm works for any number of sets, and usually yields 
    pleasing and informative diagrams. 
    However, representing more than six sets takes a long time and is hard to interpret, unless many of the 
    regions are empty. If you cannot make sense of the result, you may want to consider UpSetR
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/UpSetR/README.html>.
